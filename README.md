# 🎮 Game Title: Free Fall

## 📝 Project Description
Free Fall is a browser-based game developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure the code. Players control a basket to catch healthy fruits and avoid unhealthy items like pizza. The game includes:

1. A scoring system  
2. Time-limited gameplay
3. Multiple levels of difficulty
4. Cross-platform support (touch and mouse input, no keyboard)

## 🎯 Gameplay Mechanics

1. Objects (fruits and pizzas) fall from the top of the screen in quadratic motion (parabolic trajectory).
2. Players control a basket at the bottom using mouse drag or touch gestures.
3. Catching healthy fruits increases the score.
4. Catching pizza adds a penalty. If more than 5 pizzas are caught, the player loses.
5. A countdown timer ends the game once time is up, displaying the final score.
6. Collision detection determines if an item is successfully caught by the basket.
